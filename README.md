# TOA vLLM / LLM-D Hackathon

**Date:** April 25, 2026 | **Location:** The Open Accelerator, Fortpoint, Boston

Materials for running a one-day hackathon focused on LLM inference with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [llm-d](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d). Includes pre-configured GPU environments on NVIDIA Brev, setup scripts, benchmarking tools, and an attendee guide.

## Tiers at a glance

| Tier | GPU | Models | Tracks |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| **1 — App Builder** | 1x L40S (48 GB) | Llama 3.1 8B | RAG, BYOP, Eval |
| **2 — Performance** | 2x A100 80 GB | 8B + 70B | Quantization, Speculative Decode, Eval |
| **3 — Deep Tech** | 4x A100 80 GB | 8B + 70B | Distributed Inference, llm-d, K8s |
| **4 — Agentic Edge** 🏆 | 1x A100/H100 80 GB | Llama 3.1 8B + Nemotron profiles | **Track 5 — NVIDIA GPU Prize** |

## How to use

### 1. Create Brev Launchables

For each tier you plan to offer:

1. Open the [NVIDIA Brev Console](https://brev.nvidia.com/).
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the tier's `BREV_CONFIG.md`.
3. Paste the contents of the tier's `setup.sh` as the setup script.
4. Publish the Launchable with link sharing enabled.

Each Launchable will provision a GPU instance with models pre-downloaded, tools installed, and starter scripts ready to go.

### 2. Share with attendees

Distribute the Launchable links to attendees along with the [Attendee Guide](attendee-guide.md). The guide covers:

- How to connect to their environment (Jupyter, SSH, API)
- What's pre-installed per tier
- Quick-start recipes for each of the 6 hackathon tracks
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 3. Build a NemoClaw agent (Track 5 — NVIDIA GPU Prize)

The [`demo/nemoclaw-agent/`](demo/nemoclaw-agent/) directory contains the full Track 5 scaffold — Starter template, Builder reference agent, four inference profiles, and a latency benchmark harness. Deploy the Tier-4 Launchable and walk through the three tiers in `demo/nemoclaw-agent/README.md`.

```bash
bash /workspace/start_vllm_server.sh      # start vLLM with tool-calling enabled
bash /workspace/onboard_nemoclaw.sh       # wire NemoClaw to the local vLLM
nemoclaw agentic-edge connect             # enter the sandboxed agent environment
```

### 4. Run the ZeroClaw code assistant demo

The [`demo/`](demo/) directory contains a ready-to-run code assistant that shows how quantized local LLMs handle everyday coding tasks (explain, refactor, review) while automatically routing complex reasoning (architecture review, security audit) to a cloud model like Claude.

**On a laptop (Ollama):**
```bash
cd demo && bash install.sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
zeroclaw start
```

**On a Brev GPU instance (vLLM):**
```bash
cp demo/config.vllm.toml ~/.zeroclaw/config.toml
cp demo/skills/*.md ~/.zeroclaw/workspace/skills/
zeroclaw start
```

See the full [demo walkthrough](demo/examples/walkthrough.md) for a guided script attendees can follow.

### 5. Estimate costs

Open `hackathon-gpu-cost-estimate.xlsx` to review and adjust GPU instance costs based on expected team count and session duration.

### 6. Review & plan

- [`docs/TRACK-ALIGNMENT-REVIEW.md`](docs/TRACK-ALIGNMENT-REVIEW.md) — source of truth for how each track-kit maps to the official event page, with the current gap-closure status.
- [`docs/UPSTREAM-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE.md`](docs/UPSTREAM-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE.md) — per-track paths to a merged PR (relevant for the Best Upstream Contribution prize).
- [`docs/PODMAN-NOTES.md`](docs/PODMAN-NOTES.md) — Podman vs. Docker compatibility matrix.
- [`docs/REVIEW-AND-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](docs/REVIEW-AND-IMPROVEMENTS.md) — historical Track 5 rationale and Brev/Launchable deployment notes.

## Hackathon tracks

Each track has three skill lanes (Starter / Builder / Deep Tech). Starter kits linked below:

1. **Lean Inference Challenge** — Quantize models and optimize throughput · [Track 1 Deep Tech kit](projects/track1-redhat-fp8/README.md) · [beginner quant starter](projects/beginner-shrink-to-fit/README.md) · [intermediate GPTQ/AWQ](projects/intermediate-compress-and-compare/README.md)
2. **RAG on Open Inference** — Build retrieval-augmented generation apps on vLLM · [Track 2 Builder kit (LlamaIndex + RAGAs + reranker)](projects/track2-ragas-rerank/README.md) · [beginner RAG starter](projects/beginner-ask-my-docs/README.md)
3. **Speculative Futures** — Speed up inference with speculative decoding · [Track 3 Speculators Zoo (EAGLE/Medusa/N-gram)](projects/track3-speculators-zoo/README.md) · [intermediate speed demon](projects/intermediate-speed-demon/README.md)
4. **Inference at Scale** — Deploy llm-d on Kubernetes with disaggregated serving · [Track 4 Builder kit (multi-model + A/B canary)](projects/track4-inference-gateway/README.md) · [advanced infinite scale (Deep Tech)](projects/advanced-infinite-scale/README.md)
5. **Agentic Edge powered by NemoClaw** 🏆 (NVIDIA GPU Prize) — High-accuracy, steerable agents on vLLM · [Track 5 guide](demo/nemoclaw-agent/README.md)
6. **Performance Tuning & Evaluation** — Benchmark and evaluate with GuideLLM / Prometheus / lm-eval · [Track 6 perf lab](projects/track6-perf-lab/README.md)

> 💡 **Best Upstream Contribution prize** is awarded to the work most likely to land as a merged PR in vLLM, llm-d, or related projects. Every track kit above flags specific submission angles that target upstream contribution directly.
